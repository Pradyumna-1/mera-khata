Bees play a crucial role in pollinating plants, including many crops that humans rely on for food. Their pollination services contribute to biodiversity by supporting the growth of various plant species. Without bees, the food supply would be severely impacted, leading to lower crop yields and the collapse of ecosystems that depend on those plants. Unfortunately, bees face threats from habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change, which have caused significant population declines. Protecting bees is essential for the health of ecosystems and agriculture.
